# Uber Data Engineering Project

Excited to share my latest projectâ€”Uber Data Analytics! ðŸš€ 

In this project, I built a data model using LucidChart with fact and dimension tables to analyze Uber-related trip data. This project uses Google Cloud Services to process and analyze large datasets efficiently. 

<h2>ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:</h2>
âœ… <b>Google Cloud Storage</b> â€“ Stored raw taxi trip data before processing.</br>
âœ… <b>Compute Instance</b> â€“ Set up a virtual machine for data transformations.</br>
âœ… <b>Python</b> â€“ Used for data cleaning, transformation, and automation.</br>
âœ… <b>Mage</b> Data Pipeline Tool â€“ Built ETL pipelines for data ingestion.</br>
âœ… <b>BigQuery</b> â€“ Designed a scalable data warehouse, optimized queries, and performed advanced analytics using SQL & Python.</br>

<h2>ðŸ“Š Dataset Used:</h2>
TLC Trip Record Data ðŸ“‚ (Yellow & Green taxi trip records) with details like </br>
- pickup/drop-off times, </br>
- locations, </br>
- fares, </br>
- payment types, and more!

This project has been an incredible learning experience, and Iâ€™m excited to continue refining it.

# Uber Data Engineering Project

Excited to share my latest project—Uber Data Analytics! 🚀 

In this project, I built a data model using LucidChart with fact and dimension tables to analyze Uber-related trip data. This project uses Google Cloud Services to process and analyze large datasets efficiently. 

<h2>🔹 Tech Stack:</h2>
✅ <b>Google Cloud Storage</b> – Stored raw taxi trip data before processing.</br>
✅ <b>Compute Instance</b> – Set up a virtual machine for data transformations.</br>
✅ <b>Python</b> – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and automation.</br>
✅ <b>Mage</b> Data Pipeline Tool – Built ETL pipelines for data ingestion.</br>
✅ <b>BigQuery</b> – Designed a scalable data warehouse, optimized queries, and performed advanced analytics using SQL & Python.</br>

<h2>📊 Dataset Used:</h2>
TLC Trip Record Data 📂 (Yellow & Green taxi trip records) with details like </br>
- pickup/drop-off times, </br>
- locations, </br>
- fares, </br>
- payment types, and more!


<h2>🏗 Data Model:</h2>
Designed a data model with fact and dimension tables in LucidChart to optimize storage and query performance. </br> </br>
